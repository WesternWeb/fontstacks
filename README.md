# Fantastic Font Stacks
A super rough guide to approximating font stacks and fallback fonts.

## Why?
FOUT (flash of unstyled text) sucks, but it's a feature, not a bug. Inspired by https://speakerdeck.com/bramstein/the-consequences-of-web-fonts, this guide is an attempt to minimize the pain of FOUT by matching up fallback fonts with web fonts of similar appearance and proportions.
